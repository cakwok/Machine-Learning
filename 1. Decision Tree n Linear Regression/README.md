Introduction
------------

By studying the Iris dataset, the first part of the tasks are to build a classification decision tree to machine-classify species of Iris, with given measurement of pedal and fedal length and width, then test the model to measure accuracy. 

The classifiers are aimed to built from scratch, then there would be another cross reference codes written with sklearn library to verify result.

Then the same process would be repeated by modelling a linear regression, additionally, we would be studying the codes and performance by batch gradient decent and stohastic gradient decent here.

Tools: Python, sklearn and google colab notebook.
